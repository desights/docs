# ðŸ“ƒ Registry

Registry is one of the most important component of Desights Protocol. Every entity that exists within Desights Protocol (Solvers, Funders, Pools, Assets, Challenges etc) are all registered on Registry. If it doesn't exist in Registry, then its not part of Desights ecosystem. \

Apart from being a registration hub, Registry is also responsible for facilitating the creation of various entities like User (Solvers & Funders) Profiles and Challenges. \
