# ðŸ’² CrowdFund

### Issues with Current Crowdfunding in the AI Ecosystem

1. **Centralization of Power and Resources**
   * **Dominance of Large Entities**: Major corporations and well-funded entities dominate AI research and development, limiting opportunities for smaller developers and independent researchers.
   * **Resource Inequality**: Smaller teams often lack access to necessary resources, funding, and infrastructure, creating a significant barrier to entry.
2. **Lack of Transparency and Trust**
   * **Opaque Funding Processes**: Traditional crowdfunding platforms often lack transparency in how funds are allocated and managed, leading to mistrust among backers.
   * **Risk of Fraud**: The centralized nature of these platforms makes them susceptible to fraudulent activities, with limited mechanisms for accountability and verification.
3. **Inequitable Distribution of Benefits**
   * **Limited Contributor Rewards**: Backers and contributors often receive minimal rewards or recognition for their support, with most benefits accruing to project initiators.
   * **Ownership Concentration**: Centralized platforms typically concentrate ownership and control, marginalizing the contributions and interests of smaller stakeholders.
4. **High Fees and Inefficiencies**
   * **Platform Fees**: Traditional crowdfunding platforms charge significant fees for their services, reducing the overall funding available for projects.
   * **Administrative Overheads**: The centralized management of these platforms leads to administrative inefficiencies, delaying project timelines and increasing costs.
5. **Inflexible Funding Models**
   * **All-or-Nothing Campaigns**: Many platforms use rigid funding models where projects only receive funds if they meet their full funding goal, which can be challenging for innovative or niche AI projects.
   * **Limited Funding Options**: Traditional platforms often provide limited options for backers, such as one-time contributions without the possibility of ongoing support or equity stakes.
6. **Barrier to Community Collaboration**
   * **Isolated Project Development**: Current platforms lack mechanisms to facilitate ongoing collaboration and community involvement in project development.
   * **Limited Feedback Mechanisms**: There are few opportunities for backers to provide feedback or participate in project governance, leading to a disconnect between project teams and their communities.
7. **Regulatory and Compliance Challenges**
   * **Legal and Regulatory Barriers**: Traditional crowdfunding models must navigate complex legal and regulatory landscapes, which can limit their ability to operate globally and inclusively.
   * **Lack of Standardization**: The absence of standardized protocols and practices across platforms creates inconsistencies and complicates cross-platform collaboration and integration.\

These issues highlight the need for a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven approach to crowdfunding in the AI ecosystem. Desights aims to address these challenges by developing decentralised Crowdfunding toolkit to create a more equitable, efficient, and collaborative platform for AI innovation funding.
