### Issues with Current Crowdfunding in the AI Ecosystem

<details>

<summary><strong>Centralization of Power and Resources</strong></summary>

* **Dominance of Large Entities**: Major corporations and well-funded entities dominate AI research and development, limiting opportunities for smaller developers and independent researchers.

<!---->

* **Resource Inequality**: Smaller teams often lack access to necessary resources, funding, and infrastructure, creating a significant barrier to entry.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Lack of Transparency and Trust</strong></summary>

* **Opaque Funding Processes**: Traditional crowdfunding platforms often lack transparency in how funds are allocated and managed, leading to mistrust among backers.

<!---->

* **Risk of Fraud**: The centralized nature of these platforms makes them susceptible to fraudulent activities, with limited mechanisms for accountability and verification.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Inequitable Distribution of Benefits</strong></summary>

* **Limited Contributor Rewards**: Backers and contributors often receive minimal rewards or recognition for their support, with most benefits accruing to project initiators.

<!---->

* **Ownership Concentration**: Centralized platforms typically concentrate ownership and control, marginalizing the contributions and interests of smaller stakeholders.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>High Fees and Inefficiencies</strong></summary>

* **Platform Fees**: Traditional crowdfunding platforms charge significant fees for their services, reducing the overall funding available for projects.

<!---->

* **Administrative Overheads**: The centralized management of these platforms leads to administrative inefficiencies, delaying project timelines and increasing costs.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Inflexible Funding Models</strong></summary>

* **All-or-Nothing Campaigns**: Many platforms use rigid funding models where projects only receive funds if they meet their full funding goal, which can be challenging for innovative or niche AI projects.

<!---->

* **Limited Funding Options**: Traditional platforms often provide limited options for backers, such as one-time contributions without the possibility of ongoing support or equity stakes.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Barrier to Community Collaboration</strong></summary>

* **Isolated Project Development**: Current platforms lack mechanisms to facilitate ongoing collaboration and community involvement in project development.

<!---->

* **Limited Feedback Mechanisms**: There are few opportunities for backers to provide feedback or participate in project governance, leading to a disconnect between project teams and their communities.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Regulatory and Compliance Challenges</strong></summary>

* **Legal and Regulatory Barriers**: Traditional crowdfunding models must navigate complex legal and regulatory landscapes, which can limit their ability to operate globally and inclusively.

<!---->

* **Lack of Standardization**: The absence of standardized protocols and practices across platforms creates inconsistencies and complicates cross-platform collaboration and integration.
