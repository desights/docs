### Issues with Co-ownership and Monetisation in the AI Ecosystem

<details>

<summary><strong>Complex Ownership Structures</strong></summary>

* **Ambiguous Ownership Rights**: Determining and documenting ownership rights for AI projects can be complex, especially when multiple contributors are involved. This ambiguity can lead to disputes and legal challenges.

<!---->

* **Centralized Control**: Often, centralized entities retain significant control over AI projects, limiting the influence and benefits for smaller contributors and collaborators.

</details>

<details>

<summary> <strong>Inequitable Distribution of Profits</strong></summary>

* **Profit Concentration**: Profits from AI projects are often concentrated among a few stakeholders, typically those who provide the initial funding or control the platform. This inequity can discourage broader participation and innovation.

<!---->

* **Lack of Revenue Sharing Mechanisms**: Traditional models lack efficient mechanisms for revenue sharing, making it difficult to fairly distribute profits among all contributors.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Difficulty in Monetizing Contributions</strong></summary>

* **Valuation Challenges**: Accurately valuing individual contributions, whether in terms of code, data, or intellectual property, is challenging, leading to potential undervaluation and under-compensation.

<!---->

* **Limited Monetization Options**: Contributors often have limited options for monetizing their work, relying primarily on one-time payments or royalties that may not reflect the true value of their contributions.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Transparency and Trust Issues</strong></summary>

* **Opaque Processes**: The processes for determining ownership stakes and distributing profits are often opaque, leading to mistrust among collaborators.

<!---->

* **Trust Deficits**: Without transparent and reliable systems, collaborators may be reluctant to fully commit their resources and efforts to a project.

</details>

<details>

<summary> <strong>Administrative and Legal Complexities</strong></summary>

* **Legal Barriers**: Navigating the legal landscape to establish and manage co-ownership agreements can be complex and costly.

<!---->

* **Administrative Overheads**: Managing co-ownership structures and profit-sharing arrangements involves significant administrative overhead, detracting from the focus on actual project development.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Inadequate Incentive Structures</strong></summary>

* **Weak Incentives for Collaboration**: Current systems often lack robust incentives for collaborative contributions, resulting in fewer collaborations and less innovative outcomes.

<!---->

* **Short-term Focus**: The focus on short-term gains rather than long-term co-ownership and profit-sharing can limit the sustained commitment and engagement needed for successful AI projects.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Scalability Issues</strong></summary>

* **Scalability Constraints**: As the number of contributors grows, managing co-ownership and profit distribution becomes increasingly complex, making it difficult to scale collaborative AI projects effectively.

<!---->

* **Integration Challenges**: Integrating the contributions of numerous stakeholders into a cohesive monetization strategy poses significant technical and organizational challenges.

These issues underscore the need for a more transparent, equitable, and efficient approach to co-ownership and monetization within the AI ecosystem. Desights aims to address these challenges creating a decentralized toolkit for Co-ownership and Monetisation to promote inclusivity and fairness in AI co-ownership and revenue sharing.
