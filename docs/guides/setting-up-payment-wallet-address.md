# ðŸ’² Setting up Payment Wallet address

To successfully Submit, You are now required to fill out the **Invoice Section** of your Desights Profile page. Intention is to make the payment process smooth, faster and efficient for you.&#x20;

Within this Invoice Section, Payment Wallet address is the most important and critical detail that you will need to provide. So, lets try to understand what it is :point\_down:\


**What is Payment Wallet Address?**

Payment Wallet Address is the public address of any ethereum based account (starts with 0x... and 32 bytes in size) that you would like to receive your winning rewards on. \
\
\
**Here are some Do's and Don'ts for choosing your payment wallet address**

:white\_check\_mark: Wallet address needs to be Ethereum based address (here's more info on [Ethereum Addresses](https://info.etherscan.com/what-is-an-ethereum-address/)

:white\_check\_mark: If your Payment Wallet is an EOA (Externally Owned Address), make sure you control the Private Key of that Wallet.&#x20;

:white\_check\_mark: If your Payment Wallet Address is a Smart contract address, make sure you have the ability and access to move funds from that smart contract.

:white\_check\_mark: Ideally use any popular Wallets like Metamask or Rabby to create your Payment Wallet address. This will make it easy for you to move your funds later.

:white\_check\_mark: You can use your Desights Profile Controller wallet (not Desights Profile Id) that you use to Log into Desights Platform.&#x20;

:x: Do not use your Desights Profile Id as your Payment Address because currently your Profile contract doesn't allow to move funds. And hence your funds will get stuck.

:x: Do not share Private Key with anyone else they might get access to your funds on that Wallet.&#x20;
